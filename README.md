# DS6051-Project: Playlist Generation with GPT2 

This repo stores files and materials for our Decoding LLM's Final Project - a playlist generator! Using a GPT2 model, we aim to build a model that recieves a natural language prompt such as "Classic rock roadtrip" that outputs a list of song titles and their Spotify links.
